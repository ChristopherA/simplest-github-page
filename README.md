Test of simplest GitHub page, leveraging Jekyll without Jekyll.

View at https://christophera.github.io/simplest-github-page/

## Goals

* Without using Jekyll, leverage the various files that allow you to use markdown directly with github pages.
* Pages should largely look the same when rendered from the GitHub repo page and from the git

## Using This
* [ ] Copy these files in this repo to your own github
* [ ] In your repo, turn on github pages for 'master'
* [ ] Edit the `_config.yml` to your own info
* [ ] Edit the /assets/css/style.css for your own styles
